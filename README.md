Welcome to the Cinema CLI app, where you add movies and their director into the app, so you can store them!

To launch the app, from this repo, launch a codespace and in the terminal use the commend

`` ruby app.rb``

This will launch the CLI app and you can begin storing the movies for any purpose you like!

For testing purposes run the following command to test the main cinema.rb fil

``ruby -Itest test/test_cinema.rb
``

Good luck and have fun!
