Welcome to the Cinema CLI app, where you add movies and their director into the app, so you can store them!

To launch the app, from this repo, launch a codespace and in the terminal use the commend

`` ruby app.rb``

This will launch the CLI app and you can begin storing the movies for any purpose you like!

Good luck and have fun!
